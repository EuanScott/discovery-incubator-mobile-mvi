# Discovery Incubator - Mobile (MVI Impl)

A basic Android Mobile app to integrate with my Spring Boot backend for my Discovery Health onboarding (contracted out via Entelect).
The goal of this was to re-architect the App implementation to make use of the MVI design pattern.

> Please note that this app won't work unless the 'discovery-incubator' project is running as the 2 go hand-in-hand.
